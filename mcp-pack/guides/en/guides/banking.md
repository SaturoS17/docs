Banking gives you **real bank accounts** in the name of your verified
profile: you receive funds over international rails (SEPA, SWIFT, ACH
depending on the currency), hold fiat balances and send payments to third
parties. It is a separate product from your USDT balance: **banking money
lives in your bank accounts**, not in the CBPay balance.

| Concept | Where it lives | Queried with |
|---|---|---|
| CBPay USDT balance | CBPay ledger | `GET /v1/balances` |
| Bank balances | Your bank accounts | `GET /v1/banking/accounts/{id}/balance` |

> **Note**
Banking fees come in two shapes. **Standalone fixed fees**
(`banking_customer`, `banking_account`, `banking_operation`) are debited
from your **USDT balance** when each operation executes and **refunded
automatically** if it fails. **Transactional rail fees**
(`banking_deposit`, `banking_transfer_ach`, `banking_transfer_swift`,
`banking_transfer_wire`, `banking_transfer_sepa`) are a percentage plus a
fixed amount charged **in the operation currency** (your `BANK_USD` /
`BANK_EUR` balance) — see [rail fees](#rail-fees-deposits-and-transfers).
With a fee of 0 (the default) the service is free. The `banking_fee` and
`banking_fee_asset` fields on each response show what was charged and in
which currency.

```

1. **Create your banking profile** (`POST /v1/banking/customer`) — once.
2. **Upload verification documents** and **submit for review**.
3. Once `approved`, **open accounts** per currency.
4. **Register beneficiaries** (counterparties) for third-party payments.
5. **Send payments**: quote with `prepare`, execute with `operations`.

State changes arrive through the `banking_customer_status_changed` and
`banking_operation_status_changed` webhooks ([webhooks](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/webhooks)).

## 1. Create your banking profile

Once per account. If you omit `type`, `name` or `email`, they are filled
from your CBPay account:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/customer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "USD",
    "address": { "countryIso": "CL", "city": "Santiago" }
  }'
```

Response `201`:

```json
{
  "customer_id": "9f2b…",
  "provider_id": "…",
  "status": "draft",
  "data": { "item": { "…": "…" } },
  "created_at": "2026-07-07T12:00:00Z",
  "banking_fee": "5.000000"
}
```

If your account already has a banking profile —
`409 banking_customer_exists`.

> **Note**
**Application review.** If your organization enabled banking application review, this request can answer **`202 Accepted`** with `{"status":"in_review","kind":"banking_application","review_id":"…"}` instead of `201` — the profile is created only when compliance approves the review. The banking profile fee is charged when the application is held and **refunded automatically if it is rejected**. Track the result with the webhook `txn_review_status_changed` or in [Transaction reviews](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/guides/transaction-reviews).
Check the state at any time:

```bash
curl https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/customer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## 2. Documents and verification

Upload each document as base64 (free):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/customer/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "PASSPORT",
    "filename": "passport.pdf",
    "attach": "<base64 content>"
  }'
```

Then submit the profile for review (free):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/customer/submit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Profile states: `draft` → `submitted` → `under_review` → **`approved`** or
`rejected`. The `banking_customer_status_changed` webhook notifies each
change — for your own profile (`customer_kind: self`) and for the third
parties you register (`customer_kind: third_party`, with their
`third_party_id`):

```json
{
  "account_id": "…",
  "customer_id": "9f2b…",
  "customer_kind": "self",
  "kyc_status": "approved"
}
```

## 3. Open bank accounts

With the profile `approved`, create one account per currency. Available
currencies: **USD** (ACH/Fedwire/SWIFT rails) and **EUR** (SEPA/SWIFT):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "currency": "USD", "name": "Operating USD" }'
```

Response `201` — `data` carries the details to **receive** funds (account
number/IBAN, routing, bank):

```json
{
  "account_id": "c4d1…",
  "provider_id": "…",
  "status": "active",
  "data": { "…": "…" },
  "banking_fee": "1.000000"
}
```

List your accounts, fetch the detail of a specific account, and check
balances:

```bash
curl https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

curl https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/accounts/c4d1… \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

curl https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/accounts/c4d1…/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

The detail endpoint (`GET /v1/banking/accounts/{id}`) returns the account
LIVE — name, currency, status, and under `data` the **requirements to
receive funds** (wire and local rails: bank, account number/IBAN,
routing). Use it to show the deposit instructions of a specific account
without walking the list:

```json
{
  "account_id": "c4d1…",
  "provider_id": "…",
  "source": "live",
  "data": {
    "name": "Operating USD",
    "currencyCode": "USD",
    "status": "ACCEPT",
    "requisites": [
      { "type": "SWIFT", "…": "…" },
      { "type": "LOCAL", "…": "…" }
    ]
  }
}
```

`source` tells you where the detail came from: `live` (the bank answered
in real time) or `mirror` (the bank could not serve the account at that
moment and the last known snapshot is returned — deposit requirements
remain available).

> **Note**
The list exposes only the accounts **enabled for your operation**
according to the corridor configuration. A non-enabled account does not
appear in the list and its by-id queries respond `404 not_found`.
> **Note**
**Limit for person accounts**: a person account can hold **at most 1 bank
account**. Attempting a second one returns `409 banking_account_limit`.
Company accounts have no limit.
## Third-party users (companies only)

If your account is a **company**, besides your own accounts you can
register **third-party banking users** — your end clients (persons or
companies) — each with their own identity and verification and **bank
accounts in their name**. No limit on third parties or accounts per third
party.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    verif["1. Third party KYC/KYB<br/>verification (approved)"] --> reg["2. POST third-parties<br/>(verification_id)"]
    reg --> docs["Data + documents<br/>auto-fill"]
    docs --> accts["3. POST /accounts<br/>(accounts in their name)"]
```

### Registering the third party

Registration requires the `verification_id` of an [**approved** KYC/KYB
verification](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/guides/kyc) of the third party — their single identity
inside CBPay. The type comes from the verification kind (KYC ⇒
`INDIVIDUAL`, KYB ⇒ `COMPANY`), the data (name, email, address) auto-fills
from the verified profile (whatever you send explicitly wins), and the
**already-validated documents are re-delivered automatically** to the
banking provider. The banking profile fee is charged (refunded if the
registration fails):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/third-parties \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "verification_id": "c3d4e5f6-a7b8-4c9d-0e1f-2a3b4c5d6e7f"
  }'
```

Response `201`:

```json
{
  "third_party_id": "7f2a…",
  "customer_id": "…",
  "kind": "third_party",
  "status": "pending",
  "verification_id": "c3d4e5f6-a7b8-4c9d-0e1f-2a3b4c5d6e7f",
  "documents_synced": 2,
  "registered_at": "2026-07-10T15:00:00Z",
  "banking_fee": "1.000000"
}
```

> **Note**
`documents_synced` counts the verification documents that were loaded
automatically into the third party's banking profile. If one could not be
synced (or the bank requests additional categories), upload it through the
manual document flow below and then `submit`.
> **Note**
**Application review.** With banking application review enabled, registering a third party can also answer **`202 Accepted`** (`kind: banking_application`): the third party is registered only when the review is approved, and the registration fee is refunded automatically on rejection. Track it via `txn_review_status_changed` or [Transaction reviews](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/guides/transaction-reviews).
Save the `third_party_id`: every third-party route uses it. List and fetch
(the GET carries the live verification status):

```bash
curl "https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/third-parties?page=1&page_size=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

curl https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/third-parties/7f2a… \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Third-party verification (free)

Same as your own profile, but on the third party:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/third-parties/7f2a…/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "type": "PASSPORT", "file_base64": "…" }'

curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/third-parties/7f2a…/submit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Third-party accounts

Once the third party is approved, open accounts for them (same
`banking_account` fee) and operate just like your own:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/third-parties/7f2a…/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "currency": "USD", "name": "Carlos account" }'

curl https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/third-parties/7f2a…/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

curl https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/third-parties/7f2a…/accounts/{bankAccountID}/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

- Each third party belongs to you and only you: another CBPay account can
  never see or operate it (it gets `404`).
- A **person** account attempting to create third parties receives
  `403 company_required`.
- Without `verification_id` (or with a non-approved verification) the
  registration answers `422 verification_required` /
  `422 verification_not_approved`. If you send a `type` that does not match
  the verification kind, `422 verification_kind_mismatch`. Third parties
  created before this rule keep operating normally.
- Registered third parties feed the "new users" metric of your
  [account summary](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/guides/analytics).

## 4. Register beneficiaries

To pay third parties, first register the beneficiary with their banking
details (free; it goes through moderation before it can be used):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/counterparties \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "ACME supplier",
    "profile": {
      "name": "ACME LLC",
      "address": { "addressLine1": "1 Main St", "city": "New York", "stateIso": "NY", "countryIso": "US", "postalCode": "10001" },
      "additionalInfo": { "type": "CORPORATION" }
    },
    "accounts": [
      {
        "currencyCode": "USD",
        "bank": { "name": "Test Bank", "number": "011000138" },
        "fiat": {
          "number": "0532013000",
          "routingNumber": "011000138",
          "additionalInformation": { "type": "TYPE_FIAT_US", "accountType": "CHECKING", "supportedRails": ["ACH"] }
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

List yours with `GET /v1/banking/counterparties` and attach more accounts
to an existing beneficiary with
`POST /v1/banking/counterparties/{id}/accounts`.

## 5. Send payments

Two operation types:

| `type` | What it does | `paymentType` |
|---|---|---|
| `TRANSFER` | Between your own bank accounts | `EMPTY` |
| `WITHDRAW` | To a registered beneficiary | Per rail (e.g. `SEPA_CT`) |

Quote first (free, moves no money):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/operations/prepare \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "USD",
    "type": "WITHDRAW",
    "paymentType": "SEPA_CT",
    "sourceRequisit": { "account": "c4d1…" },
    "destinationRequisit": { "beneficiar": "<beneficiary account>" },
    "amount": { "currencyCode": "USD", "units": "250", "nanos": 0 }
  }'
```

Execute with an idempotency key (the rail fee — or the legacy
`banking_operation` fee when the rail has no configuration — is charged
here):

```bash WITHDRAW (to a beneficiary)
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/operations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: acme-payment-0071" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "USD",
    "type": "WITHDRAW",
    "paymentType": "SEPA_CT",
    "sourceRequisit": { "account": "c4d1…" },
    "destinationRequisit": { "beneficiar": "<beneficiary account>" },
    "amount": { "currencyCode": "USD", "units": "250", "nanos": 0 },
    "comment": "Invoice 8841"
  }'
```

```bash TRANSFER (between your accounts)
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/operations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: internal-move-0012" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "USD",
    "type": "TRANSFER",
    "paymentType": "EMPTY",
    "sourceRequisit": { "account": "c4d1…" },
    "destinationRequisit": { "account": "<another account of yours>" },
    "amount": { "currencyCode": "USD", "units": "100", "nanos": 0 }
  }'
```

Response `202`:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "7e8a…",
  "provider_id": "…",
  "status": "pending",
  "idempotency_key": "platform:…:acme-payment-0071",
  "data": { "…": "…" },
  "banking_fee": "2.000000",
  "banking_fee_asset": "BANK_USD"
}
```

`banking_fee` and `banking_fee_asset` only appear when a fee was charged.
With a per-rail fee the asset is the operation currency (`BANK_USD` /
`BANK_EUR`); with the legacy fallback it is `USDT`.

- The final state arrives through the `banking_operation_status_changed`
  webhook (`completed` / `failed`); you can also poll
  `GET /v1/banking/operations/{id}`. Once the operation reaches a final
  state, the webhook includes its `receipt_url` and you can download the
  PDF receipt with `GET /v1/banking/operations/{id}/receipt`
  ([receipts](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/guides/receipts)).
- Retries with the same `Idempotency-Key` return the original operation
  (`idempotency_hit: true`) **without charging the fee again**.

> **Note**
**Complete traceability.** Every banking operation is recorded on your
account: it shows up in the `banking_operations` section of the
[statement](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/guides/statement), its money reconciles in the
`BANK_USD`/`BANK_EUR` mirror balances (`assets` section), and its volume
adds to the `gross_volume` in [analytics](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/guides/analytics). The
authoritative balance remains the bank's: the mirror is reconciled
periodically.
The full history, with filters:

```bash
curl "https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/banking/operations?from=2026-07-01&to=2026-07-08&status=completed&type=WITHDRAW&page_size=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "7e8a…",
      "type": "withdraw",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ],
  "meta": { "page": 1, "page_size": 50, "retrieved": 1 }
}
```

> **Note**
Every banking operation — including inbound deposits and bank fees
discovered automatically from the bank — exposes its `direction` (`in` /
`out`), net `amount`, `currency`, `counterparty` and `reference` whenever
the bank reports them. These fields are optional and appear in
`GET /v1/banking/operations` and `GET /v1/banking/operations/{id}`.
The `banking_operation_status_changed` webhook stays lightweight by design:
it carries the identifiers and the new status only, never the enriched
fields. When it fires, fetch the operation detail to read the direction,
amount, counterparty and reference. See [webhooks](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/webhooks).

## Rail fees (deposits and transfers)

On top of the standalone fixed fees, banking supports **transactional fees
per rail** — a percentage plus a fixed amount, always charged **in the
operation currency** (`BANK_USD` / `BANK_EUR`), never in USDT:

| Service | Applies to | When it is charged |
|---|---|---|
| `banking_deposit` | Incoming deposits (USD/EUR) | When the deposit is credited — **capped at the deposit amount** (`fee = min(fee, amount)`), so a small deposit never goes negative |
| `banking_transfer_ach` | Outgoing ACH transfers | At dispatch, with a fail-closed balance check |
| `banking_transfer_swift` | Outgoing SWIFT transfers | At dispatch, with a fail-closed balance check |
| `banking_transfer_wire` | Outgoing wire transfers (FEDWIRE) | At dispatch, with a fail-closed balance check |
| `banking_transfer_sepa` | Outgoing SEPA transfers | At dispatch, with a fail-closed balance check |

For **transfers** the available balance must cover `amount + fee` — if it
does not, the API answers `402 insufficient_funds` and the operation is
**not created**. If the operation is definitively rejected right after
dispatch, the fee is **refunded automatically** (same discipline as the
legacy fee).

**Fallback:** if the rail has no specific configuration (neither at account
nor at platform level), the legacy `banking_operation` fee (fixed, in USDT)
applies. A rail configured with 0% + 0 fixed is **explicitly free** — it
does *not* fall back to the legacy fee.

## Operation statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Accepted, awaiting processing |
| `processing` | Executing on the banking rail |
| `completed` | The money arrived — final |
| `failed` | Failed; the operation fee (if any) was refunded |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled before execution |

## Errors

| HTTP | `error` | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `idempotency_key_required` | Send the key in body or header |
| 402 | `insufficient_funds` | Not enough balance: with a per-rail fee the check is `balance ≥ amount + fee` in the **operation currency** (`BANK_USD`/`BANK_EUR`); with the legacy fallback it is your USDT balance |
| 403 | `account_blocked` | The account is not active; contact the CBPay team |
| 409 | `banking_customer_exists` | Your account already has a banking profile (`GET /v1/banking/customer`) |
| 409 | `no_banking_customer` | Create your profile first (`POST /v1/banking/customer`) |
| 409 | `banking_account_limit` | Person accounts can hold at most 1 bank account |
| 403 | `company_required` | Third-party users are available for company accounts only |
| 422 | `verification_required` | Third-party registration requires the `verification_id` of an approved verification ([verify first](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/guides/kyc)) |
| 422 | `verification_not_approved` | The referenced verification is not approved yet; wait for approval |
| 422 | `verification_kind_mismatch` | The `type` sent does not match the verification kind (KYC ⇒ INDIVIDUAL, KYB ⇒ COMPANY) |
| 422 | `verification_invalid` | You referenced your onboarding verification; the third party needs their own |
| 404 | `not_found` | The third party (or the verification) does not exist or does not belong to your account |
| 502 | `banking_request_failed` | Banking corridor error; the fee was refunded — retry |

The general error catalog lives in [Errors](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/errors).

## FAQ

#### Does banking money show up in my USDT balance?
No. Banking money lives in your bank accounts and is queried with
`GET /v1/banking/accounts/{id}/balance`. The authoritative balance is the
bank's; your [statement](https://docs.cbpayapp.com/en/guides/statement) reconciles it in the
`BANK_USD`/`BANK_EUR` mirror balances. **Per-rail fees** are charged in the
operation currency (your `BANK_USD`/`BANK_EUR` balance); only the legacy
`banking_operation` fallback fee is debited from your USDT balance.
#### What happens to the fee if an operation fails?
It is refunded automatically — profile, account and operation fees alike,
including per-rail fees (refunded on the definitive synchronous rejection).
A retry with the same `Idempotency-Key` returns the original operation
(`idempotency_hit: true`) and never charges twice.
#### How many bank accounts can I open?
One per currency (USD, EUR). Additionally, **person** accounts can hold at
most 1 bank account in total (`409 banking_account_limit`); company
accounts have no limit.
#### Why doesn't one of my accounts appear in the list?
The list only exposes accounts **enabled for your operation** per the
corridor configuration. A non-enabled account does not appear and its
by-id queries answer `404 not_found` — contact your CBPay team if you need
it enabled.
#### Can a person account register third-party users?
No — third parties are a company feature (`403 company_required`).
Registration also requires the `verification_id` of an **approved** KYC/KYB
verification of the third party.
#### How do I know when a payment reached its final state?
Subscribe to `banking_operation_status_changed`: it fires on `completed` /
`failed` and includes the `receipt_url` once final. You can also poll
`GET /v1/banking/operations/{id}`.
