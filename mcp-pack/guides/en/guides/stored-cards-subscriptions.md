The `card` method supports **stored credentials** (the card brands' COF
mandate): your payer saves their card with explicit consent on the first
payment, and afterwards you can offer one-click payment without re-typing
the number — or charge subscriptions and unscheduled amounts yourself
without the payer present. The card number **never exists** in your
integration or on the platform: only an opaque processor reference plus
display data (brand, last 4 digits, expiry) is stored.

### Seed: offer to save the card on the first payment

Create the `card` payin with `save_card: true` and your payer reference:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/payins \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "country": "BO",
    "currency": "BOB",
    "method": "card",
    "amount": "700.00",
    "save_card": true,
    "payer_reference": "customer-1042",
    "idempotency_key": "topup-7720"
  }'
```

The hosted page shows a **"Save this card for future payments"** checkbox.
The credential is stored ONLY if the payer ticks it and the 3-D Secure
payment is approved. On credit you receive the `card_stored` webhook and
the card appears in your list.
### List the payer's cards

```bash
curl "https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/stored-cards?from=2026-07-01&to=2026-07-20&payer_reference=customer-1042" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

```json
{
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50,
  "stored_cards": [{
    "stored_card_id": "5f0f2c9e-…",
    "payer_reference": "customer-1042",
    "country": "BO",
    "currency": "BOB",
    "brand": "visa",
    "last4": "2701",
    "expiry_month": "12",
    "expiry_year": "2028",
    "status": "active",
    "created_at": "2026-07-20T18:00:00Z"
  }]
}
```
### Pay with a saved card (payer present)

Create the `card` payin with `stored_card_id`: the page skips card entry,
shows the saved card (`VISA •••• 2701`) and 3-D Secure still runs — the
payer only confirms with their bank. The **billing details** the payer
entered when saving the card are also kept on file: the page applies them
automatically and shows only a masked summary (name, partial email, city)
with a "use different details" link in case they want to change them —
nothing is retyped. This server-to-server path needs no extra verification:
you already know your customer.

Don't know which card they have saved (or whether they have one)? Don't
pass `stored_card_id`: the payment page lets the payer discover their cards
by verifying their email with a code — see
[the payer discovers their cards](#the-payer-discovers-their-cards-on-the-payment-page).

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/payins \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "country": "BO",
    "currency": "BOB",
    "method": "card",
    "amount": "350.00",
    "stored_card_id": "5f0f2c9e-…",
    "idempotency_key": "topup-7721"
  }'
```
### Recurring / unscheduled charge (payer not present)

Charge the card directly — subscriptions (`recurring: true`) or
unscheduled amounts your customer agreed to:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/stored-cards/5f0f2c9e-…/charges \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "45.00",
    "description": "Monthly subscription",
    "recurring": true,
    "idempotency_key": "sub-2026-07-cust1042"
  }'
```

Response `201` — an approved charge credits your balance automatically
(`payin_credited` webhook, same path as any card payin):

```json
{
  "payin_id": "3c5b002c-…",
  "status": "pending",
  "reference": "3c5b002c-…",
  "transaction_id": "7846012604…",
  "note": "charge approved; the balance is credited automatically (payin_credited webhook)"
}
```

An issuer decline responds `422` with the payin in `failed` and a
`failure_reason`. A retry with the same `idempotency_key` returns the
original payin and **never charges twice**.
To revoke a saved card (at the payer's request or on suspicion):
`DELETE /v1/stored-cards/{stored_card_id}` — charges stop working
immediately and you receive `stored_card_revoked`
(`422 stored_card_revoked` if you try to charge it afterwards).

> **Important**
Charges without the payer present travel **without 3-D Secure** by
definition of the mandate: the chargeback risk is yours. Charge only what
your customer explicitly agreed to — the platform persists the seed's
consent evidence (checkbox, IP and timestamp) for disputes.
## The payer discovers their cards on the payment page

Every card payment page — the `payment_url` of a `card` payin and the card
option of the universal checkout — asks for the **payer's email as the
first field**. If that email has saved cards with you, the page sends a
**verification code** (branded with your organization's identity) and only
once they enter it correctly does it reveal their cards: brand, last 4
digits and expiry, never the full number. Picking one pays with 3-D Secure
without re-typing it; they can also choose "use another card" and pay with
a new one.

### The payer types their email

If you already sent it in `customer.email` (or a `payer_reference` holding
an email), the page shows it pre-filled. If the email has no saved cards,
the new-card form carries on — nothing is revealed.
### They verify it with the code (once per device)

When cards are found, the page emails a code and asks for it. The
**"Remember this device"** checkbox (checked by default) trusts the device
for **30 days**: later payments with that email in that browser show the
cards without asking for a code.
### They pick the card and pay

With the email verified, the payer sees their masked cards, picks one and
only completes 3-D Secure. The **verified** email becomes the payer
identity of the charge — it wins over any email typed into the form.
> **Note**
Trust is per device and lasts 30 days; each payer can have up to 10
remembered devices (the oldest is forgotten past the cap). If a payer loses
a device, support can revoke their remembered devices and they will get a
code again on their next payment.
## Subscriptions (scheduled recurring charges)

Instead of charging manually every month, let **the platform run the
schedule**: create a subscription on the saved card — the first period is
charged on creation (unless `start_at` is in the future) and the rest fire
automatically per `interval`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "stored_card_id": "5f0f2c9e-…",
    "amount": "45.00",
    "interval": "monthly",
    "description": "Monthly plan",
    "idempotency_key": "plan-cust1042-monthly"
  }'
```

Response `201` (`first_charge` is present when the first period was charged
on creation):

```json
{
  "subscription_id": "7a1c9e2d-…",
  "stored_card_id": "5f0f2c9e-…",
  "amount": "45.00",
  "currency": "BOB",
  "interval": "monthly",
  "status": "active",
  "period": 1,
  "next_charge_at": "2026-08-20T18:00:00Z",
  "first_charge": { "outcome": "approved", "payin_id": "3c5b002c-…" }
}
```

- `interval`: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly` or `yearly`. The day of month is
  kept and clamped to the last day in short months (a plan on the 31st
  charges on Feb 28/29 and returns to the 31st in March).
- `start_at` (optional, future RFC3339): defers the first charge (trial /
  start date); without it, it charges on creation.
- **Dunning**: on an issuer decline the platform retries every 24h up to 3
  times; exhausted, the subscription becomes `past_due` and you get the
  `subscription_status_changed` webhook. `resume` reactivates it with a
  fresh attempt.
- Each successful charge credits your balance like any card payin
  (`payin_credited` webhook, carrying `subscription_id` to link it to the
  plan).

Lifecycle management:

```bash
# Pause (stops charging; resuming does NOT catch up missed periods)
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/subscriptions/7a1c9e2d-…/pause -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
# Resume
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/subscriptions/7a1c9e2d-…/resume -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
# Cancel (terminal)
curl -X POST https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/subscriptions/7a1c9e2d-…/cancel -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
# List / read
curl "https://api.qbank.cl/platform/v1/subscriptions?from=2026-07-01&to=2026-07-31&status=active" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Revoking the saved card (`DELETE /v1/stored-cards/{id}`) automatically
cancels its subscriptions (`cancel_reason: card_revoked`).
## Subscription states

| Status | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `active` | Charges every period on `next_charge_at` | Nothing — the scheduler runs it |
| `paused` | Frozen; missed periods are **not** charged retroactively | `POST .../resume` when ready |
| `past_due` | 3 dunning retries (24 h apart) failed | Fix the card/balance and `resume` to reactivate |
| `canceled` | Terminal — by `cancel` or because the stored card was revoked | Create a new subscription if needed |

## Errors

| HTTP | Code | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `idempotency_key_required` | Send `idempotency_key` (body or `Idempotency-Key` header) |
| 400 | `invalid_amount` | `amount` must be a positive decimal string |
| 400 | `invalid_interval` | Use `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly` or `yearly` |
| 400 | `invalid_request` | The currency must match the stored card corridor |
| 404 | `not_found` | The stored card / subscription does not exist or is not yours |
| 409 | `idempotency_conflict` | Same key with a different payload — use a new key |
| 409 | `subscription_state` | The current state does not allow that action (e.g. resuming a canceled plan) |
| 422 | `stored_card_revoked` | The card credential was revoked; ask the payer to save it again |
| 422 | `core_rejected` | The charge was declined by the rail — the message carries the reason |

## FAQ

#### Do you store the card number (PAN)?
Never. Saving a card stores an opaque network token — the PAN never touches
the platform. Revoking the credential invalidates the token.
#### Why don't recurring charges ask for 3-D Secure?
Merchant-initiated transactions (MIT) run without 3DS by card-network
mandate: the payer authenticated with 3DS on the initial consented payment,
and every MIT references that transaction.
#### What happens to subscriptions if the card is revoked?
They are canceled automatically (`card_revoked`). The payer must save the
card again and you create a new subscription.
#### Does pausing accumulate charges?
No — there is no catch-up: periods elapsed while paused advance the counter
without charging. Resuming charges from the next due period only.
#### How does dunning work when a charge declines?
The scheduler retries up to 3 times, 24 h apart. If all fail the plan moves
to `past_due` and you receive `subscription_status_changed` — no more
charges until you `resume`.
#### When is the first charge collected?
Synchronously at creation, unless you pass a future `start_at` (trial):
then the first charge waits for that date.
#### Why does the payment page ask for a code sent to the payer's email?
To show their saved cards without letting anyone who knows their email see
them: the list is only revealed after the email is verified with the code
(or on an already remembered device). If the email has no cards, the page
carries straight on to the new-card form.
#### Must the payer verify their email on every payment?
No: with "Remember this device" (checked by default) the browser stays
trusted for 30 days and later payments with that email show the cards
without a code. After that — or on another device — they verify again.
